## ðŸ“– Overview

This portfolio website showcases my skills, projects, and experience in the world of web development. It is designed to be responsive, visually appealing, and user-friendly.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- Node.js
- MongoDB (optional, if you want to run the API locally)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Karishma271/Portfolio.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd portfolio
   ```

3. Install dependencies for both the frontend and backend:

   ```bash
   cd Frontend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   cd Backend
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

## Running the Backend API

1. If you haven't already, make sure MongoDB is running locally on your machine.

2. Navigate to the server directory:

   ```bash
   cd Backend
   ```

3. Start the Node.js server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start the backend API at `http://localhost:8888`.

## Running the Frontend React App

1. Navigate to the client directory:

   ```bash
   cd Frontend
   ```

2. Start the React development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the frontend React app at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

Once both the backend API and frontend React app are running, you can visit `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser to view the portfolio website.
